# Cyanobacterial clock models

The jupyter notebook reproduces all results of "On the robustness of the in vivo cyanobacterial circadian clock" by Dorota Youmbi Fuego and Sophie de Buyl https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03950 . To run the notebook fast, you can rely on the results of simulations kept in "results". For this you need to keep run_full_notebook_fast = True. If you want to reproduce the results fully, change run_full_notebook_fast to False. 

The notebook contains the in vitro model of https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1408692111 .
