# cyano_clock_models

The jupyter notebook reproduces all results of "On the robustness of the in vivo cyanobacterial circadian clock" by Dorota Youmbi Fuego and Sophie de Buyl https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03950 . To run the notebook fast, you can rely on the results of simulations kept in "results". For this you need to keep run_full_notebook_fast = True. If you want to reproduce the results fully, change run_full_notebook_fast to False.
